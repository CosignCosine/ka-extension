There's Rick's nihilistic outlook for instance, which draws heavily from (ISDjflsjf) literature.

Every time someone mentions jett burns the bot says deez nut
hAKER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what do you have in mind
wOAH
that would require some serious http requests a
very expensive
unless you want to whitelist certain programs or users


Very literature what
maybe just have it only on one program
Idk
But how do you get a users fkey if you know their username and password

i havn't tested THIS, but you might be able to log in and store the request's cookies in some sort of cookie manager object
just a though
or you could use oauth
But fkeys change everydayBRO
#
exactly
which iss why you should fucking kill yourself
i agree
which is why you could use oauth to get a new oauth token every time you want to make authenitcated api requests
